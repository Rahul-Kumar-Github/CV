/*
Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of variable-length arrays) and q (the number of queries).

Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 … a[i]k-1 describing the k-element array located at a[i].


Each of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of i (an index in array a) and j (an index in the array referenced by a[i]) for a query.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= q <= 105
1 <= k <= 3 . 105
n <= Σk <= 3 . 105
0 <= i < n
0 <= j < k
All indices in this challenge are zero-based.
All the given numbers are non negative and are not greater than 106.
Output Format
For each pair of i and j values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer that denotes the element located at index j of the array referenced by a[i]. There should be a total of q lines of output.

Sample Input

2 2
3 1 5 4
5 1 2 8 9 3
0 1
1 3
Sample Output


5
9
Explanation
The diagram below depicts our assembled Sample Input:

We perform the following q=2 queries:

 Find the array located at index i = 0 , which corresponds to a[i] = [1,5,4]. We must print the value at index j=1 of this array which, as you can see, is 5.
Find the array located at index i=1 , which corresponds to a[i] = [1,2,8,9,3]. We must print the value at index j=3 of this array which, as you can see, is 9.

/* what they want us to do in this question 
Sample Input

2 2          // here they want us to take n( no of variable length)= 2 and q( no of queries )=2
3 1 5 4      // here 3 is the size of array which is taken by user and followed by we have taken users array element input of 3 sized array
5 1 2 8 9 3   //similarly for 5 sized array
0 1           //here we are asking no of array(nth) and its position . for example for 0th array and its position 1st value which will give 5
1 3          //similarly for 1st array and its position 3rd = 9

hence i have given code for better understanding .Kindly use it without all cout part for clearing all test cases .Cheers !!
